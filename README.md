"Text2Images" this project consists of two similar applications that convert text to images and save them locally or open them automatically in a web browser.

The first application, "text2images_localsave.py", runs using the installed "base64" and "webbrowser" libraries. This app finds images from texts and automatically enumerates filenames and saves them locally. This way, you can easily convert texts to images and store them wherever you want.

The second application is called "text2images_webbrow.py" and it also converts text to images in the same way. But this time, it automatically opens the found image in your web browser. This is a great way to quickly visualize and share your texts.
